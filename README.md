This is a rewritten version. The LEGACY version can be found [here](https://github.com/luqmanity/matta-legacy).

### Join the Discord Server for support, etc:

This is a general-purpose, all-in-one Discord bot designed to be helpful and customisable according to the exact
needs and wants, requirements and situations of servers and communities.

Made using Python, Pycord fork of the discord library. Some JSON is used for data saving.
Ping me on Discord via the server if you would like to be a contributor. Commands anf different
scripts are separated using cogs extensions with Pycord.

This repo includes an overview of how to run the bot, and the default commands.

**Usage of the source code for commercial, private, or fun uses is allowed, as long as this repo is credited. The crediting needs to be easily visible.**

# How to run
## 1 - Discord application, bot
You'll need a Discord bot token in order for this to work. Head over to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and create/select an application.
Open the application, then go to the Bots page and click that reset token button to generate a token.
**Do note that if you have an existing code that uses a token, clicking that reset disables the old token and you'll have to use the newly generated one.**

Copy the token displayed. If you have 2FA enabled, you may need to enter authorization code.

## 2 - Setup
Setting up is easy, simply run `main.py` and it will ask if to open **Config Panel** - simply
proceed by inputting **y**.  It should output a panel on the console, that shows available actions and
it's description. Simply input "setup", and once "setup complete" is outputted, all required folders
and files should be created in the project folder.

**The folders and files created are required for the bot to function, but is excluded from 
this repo so that anyone can just keep their old data even when running off a newer version.**

**Alternatively**, you can run the `config.py` script located in the project.

Please note that if you ran `main.py` to open the Config Panel, the bot will run after
the Config Panel closed (using `quit`).

## 3 - Token
Now that we've got all the required files and folders, all that is left is the bot token. Open the `data`
folder in the project folder (by default: matta/data), then open `.env`.

Once opened, edit to include the following variable:
```env
TOKEN = "Your Bot Token"
```

Your Discord bot should work now! Do note that Discord will reset/disable the token if they found it
somewhere in the internet. Discord will DM you to inform if that happens. Please do **NOT** share your
discord bot's token anywhere unsecure, and it's best to keep it to yourself or your team. If you need
to share the token, please encrypt it so only those with the key(s) can view the token.

# Updating
You can easily update the bot by donwloading the source code, then running `config.py`. The process
is similar to setting up this bot when you first started earlier. The `setup` function will check
what files, folders, etc is missing, then later creates it. *If it exists but is on an outdated format,
it will be updated and included with new data. (Planned)*

## Autoresponder
Autoresponders works by having a dictionary storing all the triggers and responses for a unique autoresponder in each server.
It can also be edited and toggled, or even deleted. It's just here for fun so you can at least do some conversations
with bots in a lonely server lol.

# Config Panel
This project includes `config.py`, which is a console-based panel created specifically help with 
a variety of tools that can help you manage and customise the bot the way you want it to be!

The Config Panel is updated in every major release.
